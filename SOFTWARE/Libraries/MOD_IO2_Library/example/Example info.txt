This is example demo for Olimex board Olimexino-85 rev.E connected to MOD-IO2 rev.B.

The project is compiled and tested with Digispark Arduino 1.0.4

In order to work you have to copy the MOD_IO2_Library located in the root directory to the "libraries" directory of your Arduino IDE.
Select your board: Tools --> Board --> Digispark 8 mhz - NO USB (Tiny Core)
Select programmer: Tools --> Programmer --> Digispark
Connect SCL and SDA lines of I2C interface and GND:
1) Pin 0 of Olimexino-85 to pin 6 of MOD-IO2's UEXT (SDA)
2) Pin 2 of Olimexino-85 to pin 5 of MOD-IO2's UEXT (SCL)
3) Pin 5 of Olimexino-85 to pin 2 of MOD-IO2's UEXT (GND)

When you compile and program the board it should initialize I2C communication between Olimexino-85 and the slave module.
The address of the slave is selected in the source code of the example line 18:
--------------------------------------------------
		#define  MOD_IO2_ADDRESS  0x21
--------------------------------------------------
This address depends on the firmware of the MOD-IO2. So take care of it if you decide to change the firmware of MOD-IO2 since the address might be different.

The same way you can change SCL and SDA pins of I2C interface (line 19-20):
--------------------------------------------------
				#define  SCL 2
				#define  SDA 0
--------------------------------------------------

The program is toggling the slave relays with frequency ~2 seconds.

The procedure of sending data is this:
Start --> Address --> Command code --> Data --> Stop
Sending of each of them is included in the library method WriteSingleIadr (you can see the code in the MOD-IO2.cpp file).
Start and Stop bits are standard for the I2C protocol.
Address value is defined in the top of your source code (as it was described above) and it is initialized in the constructor when the object of the class is defined.
Command codes are predefined values for the firmware (macros are defined in the header file MOD-IO2.h) with specific actions.
Data is a value that the user wants to send to the slave.
For more details you can check "MOD-IO2 README.txt" where you can find the specific for the MOD-IO2 command codes and examples of the sending data via I2C protocol.
